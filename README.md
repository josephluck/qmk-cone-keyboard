# Corne keymap

This repo is a backup of my Corne Keymap.

The contents of the `josephluck` directory needs to be placed in `keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/josephluck` inside the QMK firmware repository.

Then, to build the firmware, run: `util/docker_build.sh crkbd:josephluck` and use the OSX app `QMK Firmware` to flash the generated `crkbd_rev1_common_josephluck.hex` firmware to the keyboard.
